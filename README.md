# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
In this project, I will analyze music store database using SQL. This database encompasses various aspects of a music store's operations, modeled across eleven interconnected tables — album, artist, customer, employee, genre, invoice, invoice_line, media_type, playlist, playlist_rack, track. Our goal is to extract insightful information and answer specific questions through SQL queries.
